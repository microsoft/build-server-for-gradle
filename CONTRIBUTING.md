If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, please check the following content to see how to set up the developing environment.

### Requirement

- JDK 17 or higher

### Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Build the Project

You can run `./gradlew clean build` to build the project.

### Debugging the Plugin

If you want to debug the plugin, set the system property `bsp.plugin.debug.enabled` to `true`. Then you can attach to the Gradle daemon process via port `5005`.

If you are using VS Code, launch the configuration named 'Attach Plugin' after the build server is started.
